*Leptasthenura setaria* ([grimpeiro](https://www.wikiaves.com.br/wiki/grimpeiro) or [araucaria tit-spinetail](https://ebird.org/species/artspi1)) is a bird that builds nests primarily in the canopy of the *Araucaria angustifolia* tree. Therefore, theoretically, its geographic distribution is highly dependent on the geographic distribution of the Araucaria tree. This raises a relatively simple question: does constructing a Species Distribution Model (SDM) for the *Leptasthenura setaria* using a previously built model for *Araucaria angustifolia* as a dependent variable result in a better model?
